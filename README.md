I'm a web developer with commercial experience, having worked in technology for my whole career: creating it to solve real-world business problems, writing about it for magazines and websites, and explaining it in videos that have been watched over 25 million times.

I've run my own company for many years, so I can manage projects from inception to completion; working autonomously when required to assembling and managing a team, to successfully deliver large projects on time and on budget.

In addition to project management I was responsible for delivering all technical projects for the company.

## Skills

### Key Skills
- Languages: Ruby, Javascript, Java, PHP, C++, HTML, CSS
- Frameworks: Rails, Sinatra, React
- Datastores: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Testing: RSpec, Capybara, Jest, Jasmine, Cypress
- Tools: Git, Travis, RuboCop, ESLint, Bash

### Soft Skills

#### Project Management

As a company director, I manage all projects from start to finish. I'm fully responsible for delivering projects on time and on budget, working in an agile way creating a more responsive and iterative relationship with the client.

#### Technical Writing

I've written for over thirty international publications, on topics as diverse as programming, internet culture, comprehensive hardware reviews and in-depth software features. I can explain complex topics in an understandable and engaging way.

#### Growth Mindset

I love learning new skills, and if I don't know how to do something I see it as an opportunity to learn. I embrace self-led learning and am constantly looking for new ways to enhance my skills and abilities. I also enjoy sharing new skills and techniques (when asked...) to help others learn and develop.
