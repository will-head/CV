I'm a web developer with experience creating and maintaining websites for my own company. I have supplemented this experience by attending a web developer bootcamp at Makers Academy, in order to learn how to apply my skills to a professional software team environment and refresh my Computer Science degree.

In addition to my technical skills, I bring a wealth of experience of project management, from running my own company, and I’m an accomplished technical writer, having written for over thirty international technology publications as a freelance journalist.


## Skills

### Key Skills
- Languages: Ruby, Javascript, Java, PHP, C++, HTML, CSS
- Frameworks: Rails, Sinatra, React
- Datastores: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Testing: RSpec, Capybara, Jest, Jasmine, Cypress
- Tools: Git, Travis, RuboCop, ESLint, Bash

### Soft Skills

#### Project Management

As a company director, I manage all projects from start to finish. I'm fully responsible for delivering projects on time and on budget, working in an agile way creating a more responsive and iterative relationship with the client.

#### Technical Writing

I've written for over thirty international publications, on topics as diverse as programming, internet culture, comprehensive hardware reviews and in-depth software features. I can explain complex topics in an understandable and engaging way.

#### Growth Mindset

I love learning new skills, and if I don't know how to do something I see it as an opportunity to learn. I embrace self-led learning and am constantly looking for new ways to enhance my skills and abilities. I enjoy sharing new skills and techniques (when asked...) to help others learn and develop.
