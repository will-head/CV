### Soft Skills

#### Project Management

As a company director, I manage all projects from start to finish. I'm fully responsible for delivering projects on time and on budget, working in an agile way creating a more responsive and iterative relationship with the client.

#### Technical Writing

I've written for over thirty international publications, on topics as diverse as programming, internet culture, comprehensive hardware reviews and in-depth software features. I can explain complex topics in an understandable and engaging way.

#### Growth Mindset

I love learning new skills, and if I don't know how to do something I see it as an opportunity to learn. I embrace self-led learning and am constantly looking for new ways to enhance my skills and abilities. I enjoy sharing new skills and techniques (when asked...) to help others learn and develop.
